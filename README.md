# > All Tests Passed

This is the source code for a Jekyll site where I write up detailed solutions to programming solutions I find on the web or in textbooks. [Check it out!](https://marquessv.github.io/AllTestsPassed)

Besides Jekyll, 

* I use [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) to generate CSS for the site.

* I used [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to produce a full set of favicons for various devices.

* I use [Exo 2](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo+2) by [Natanael Gama](http://www.ndiscovered.com/) for the header font, and [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) for everything else.
